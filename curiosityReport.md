For my Curiosity Report, I wanted to learn more about the other big cloud service provider, Microsoft Azure, and some of the pros and cons compared to AWS.

Azure was launched in 2010, 4 years after AWS. It has 22% of the market share compared to AWS with 33%, althought it seems that most big Azure clients are more legacy companies, or non-tech industry companies, like Nike, Dell, or Starbucks. This matches with Microsoft's reputation for being a legacy, old business software company. These companies are also more likely to use other Microsoft Business products like Windows Server and Office 365, which Azure has better integration with. AWS on the other hand is used by the biggest tech companies of the last two decoades, like Netflix or Spotify.

Azure's counterparts to the AWS products we used in this class are as follows:
- Azure Blob Storage versus S3
- Azure Front Door or Azure CDN instead of AWS CloudFront
- Azure Database for MySQL instead of AWS RDS MySQL
- Azure Container Registry (ACR) instead of AWS ECR
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure Container Instances (ACI) instead of AWS ECS
- Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates instead of AWS CloudFormation

Most of the services seemed almost identical from my reading on them. Two that I could find more interesting pros and cons on:

Pros and cons of Blob Storage versus S3:
Blob Storage will integrate natively with other Azure service and for people that use other Microsoft tools like Visual Studio. I think it would be a good fit for .NET developers for example. The pricing has 3 tiers and seems easier to manage as well.
On the other hand, AWS has a larger global footprint, meaning it gives better reliability and lower latency globally, has a more mature ecosystem, documentation and community, and better performance typically.

Pros and cons of Azure Database versus AWS RDS:
Azure will integrate better with software like Power BI that business analysts like to use. Again, lower global coverage though.

In general, there didn't seem to be huge differences between the service offerings. The main two considerations for choosing a service seem to fall to 1) Azure would have better integration with other Microsoft services you were already using but might take extra configuration for non-Azure integrations and 2) AWS usually had more extensive network and reach but could cost more in certain circucmstances.

I'm glad we learned on AWS since its the industry best product and seems to be used my more tech specific companies. I think I would continue to use AWS rather than try to learn a different cloud provider for my own practice since the knowledge seems pretty easily transferable while AWS still being the most likely for me to use in whatever companies I work at.
